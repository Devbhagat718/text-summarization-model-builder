📄 Text Summarization Model Builder
This repository contains the model training pipeline for a text summarization project using the T5 Transformer model and readability scoring using three machine learning models: Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest.

✨ Overview
This project focuses on:

Fine-tuning the T5 Transformer model for summarization tasks.

Training readability scoring models to predict the readability level of summarized text.

Exporting trained models as .joblib files for easy integration into other applications, like the Django-based Text Summarization Web App (hosted separately).

linguistic_features.py	Script to extract linguistic features (like word count, sentence count) from text data.

💻 How It Works
1️⃣ Fine-Tuning T5 for Summarization
The T5 model is fine-tuned using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Preprocessed training data is used for summarization.

The model is saved to the t5_fine_tuned/ folder for future use.

2️⃣ Readability Scoring
Three models are trained to predict readability:

Ridge Regression

Gradient Boosting

Random Forest

Each model uses text features extracted using tfidf_vectorizer.pkl and linguistic properties from linguistic_features.py.

Trained models are saved as .joblib files.

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Raw datasets (train.csv, subset_data.csv) are cleaned and saved as cleaned_subset_data.csv.

Preprocessing includes handling missing values, tokenization, and feature extraction.

⚙️ Steps to Reproduce
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Devbhagat718/text-summarization-model-builder.git
cd text-summarization-model-builder
Launch Jupyter Notebooks

Open the Summarization_code_with_T5_Model.ipynb notebook to train or fine-tune the summarization model.

Open Readability_score_with_3_models.ipynb to train the readability scoring models.

Load Data

Ensure train.csv and test.csv are available in the same directory.

Export Models

Fine-tuned T5 models and readability scoring models are saved as .joblib files for future integration.

🌟 Key Features
Summarization: Leverages the T5 Transformer for high-quality summarization.

Readability Scoring: Predicts text readability using multiple machine learning models.

Preprocessing: Provides cleaned and feature-enriched datasets for training.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Expand datasets for better generalization.

Incorporate more advanced readability scoring metrics.

Optimize summarization for different languages and domains.
